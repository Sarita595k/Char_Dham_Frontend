            <p>REFUND &amp; CANCELLATION POLICY – YUGEN INDIA TRAVEL

                Introduction
                This Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy governs cancellations and refunds for services offered by
                Yugen India Travel (“we”, “our”, “us”). By submitting an enquiry or confirming a booking,
                you agree to this policy.

                Nature of Bookings
                Yugen India Travel operates on an enquiry-based booking model. Bookings are confirmed
                only after mutual agreement and receipt of advance payment, where applicable.

                Cancellation by Customer
                • Cancellation requests must be communicated in writing via email or WhatsApp.
                • Cancellation charges depend on service providers such as hotels, transport operators, and
                vendors.
                • Charges may vary based on travel dates, season, and time of cancellation.

                Indicative Cancellation Charges
                • More than 15 days before travel: Minimal or no cancellation charges (subject to supplier
                policy)
                • 7–15 days before travel: Partial cancellation charges may apply
                • Less than 7 days before travel or no-show: No refund may be applicable

                The exact cancellation terms will be shared at the time of booking confirmation.

                Refund Policy

                • Refunds, if applicable, will be processed after deducting cancellation charges levied by
                service providers.
                • Refund processing time may take 7–14 working days.
                • Refunds will be made through the original mode of payment or mutually agreed method.
                • We are not responsible for delays caused by banks or payment service providers.

                Cancellation by Yugen India Travel
                We reserve the right to cancel a booking due to unavoidable circumstances such as:
                • Natural disasters
                • Weather conditions
                • Government restrictions
                • Operational issues

                In such cases, we will offer a suitable alternative or refund as per supplier policies.

                Non-Refundable Components
                Certain services such as permits, helicopter bookings, peak-season hotels, or special
                arrangements may be non-refundable. These will be clearly communicated at the time of
                booking.

                Force Majeure
                No refunds shall be applicable for cancellations caused due to force majeure events beyond
                our control.

                Changes to Bookings
                Any changes requested after confirmation are subject to availability and additional charges,
                if applicable.

                Policy Updates
                Yugen India Travel reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. Updates will be
                effective upon posting.
